# libft_c
My personal library for C language fonctions

HOW TO USE :
(During the compilation)
 - include the .h file thanks to the -I flags;
 - include the .a;

include the path of the libft.h in your project .h file;

Use all fonctions you need by calling their names in your project. Exemple : ft_get_file(file_name, tab_file);
